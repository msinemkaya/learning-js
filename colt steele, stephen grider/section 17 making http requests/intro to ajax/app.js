// ajax - asynchronous javascript and xml
//but no one works w/xml anymore we use JSON 

//it allows you to communicate with server behind the scenes 
//meaning ajax is using requests asynchronously so
//you dont communicate with server in between the page loads

//JSON is a format for sending data, a protocol for communicating between
//servers or/and formatting data and sending it to another server
