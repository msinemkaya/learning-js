// you can reassign the value when you use var and let

var name = "meliko";
console.log(name);
var name = "hako"; //you can not do this when using let u should do it as "name = 'hako'" because otherwise it says that name is already defined
console.log(name);

//you cant change the value of the const and also you have to assign a value when you create one
